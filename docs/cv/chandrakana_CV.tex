\section{Prior Work \\ Experience}
{\sl Research Intern} \hfill June 2016 - August 2016 \\
RiSE group, Microsoft Research, Redmond
%\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
%    \item Developed a probabilistic programming language to make statistical
%      inference a first class citizen.
%    \item Designed and implemented a debugger for probabilistic programs to work
%      with the language.
%    \item Evaluated the debugger on a variety of benchmarks demonstrating
%      the benefits of the debugger and the ability to express statistical
%      inference in the language.
%    \item Wrote and published a research paper at an ACM symposium (MAPL 2017)
%      and a workshop (PPS 2017).
%
%\end{itemize}

{\sl Research Assistant} \hfill September 2014 - June 2015 \\
Chair of Software Engineering, ETH Zurich
%\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % Reduce space between items
%\item Worked on specifying functional properties of concurrent OO programs
%  in the SCOOP concurrency model in the programming language Eiffel.
%\item This was useful for verifying the correctness of concurrent programs,
%  an incredibly challenging problem in programming language and formal methods.
%\item While at ETH, I also TA-ed for a graduate level class on concurrent programming,
%  "Concepts of Concurrent Computation". I developed exciting
%    verification assignments using model checking and Hoare Logic as part of my
%    TA work.
%\end{itemize}

{\sl Research Intern} \hfill August 2013 - August 2014 \\
ABB Corporate Research Center, Switzerland
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Designed and implemented a bi-directional model transformer
%    and compiler between two component based frameworks used for writing and
%    verifying real-time safety-critical software.
%  \item My internship was extended by another 6 months based on the success of
%    my first project.
%    I started a second project in collaboration with
%    Prof. Viktor Kuncak's lab at
%    EPFL University (Switzerland) that focused on formal verification of software.
%\item For this project, I
%  designed and implemented a framework for formally
%    specifying and checking
%    functional and real-time properties of component-based industrial software.
%\item This project also contributed to my MS thesis work at EPFL and led
%  to a publication at an international ACM Conference (CBSE 2015).

%   % \href{http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~manuel/Manuel_Oriols_Website/Profile.html} {Dr. Manuel Oriol}
%\end{itemize}

{\sl Research Intern}  \hfill June 2010 - July 2010 \\
Bio-robotics Lab, EPFL, Switzerland
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Analyzed the locomotion of a salamander from X-Ray movies and
%  implemented a graphical simulation of the temporal variations in the angles
%  at the different joints on the salamander's body
%\item This was very useful for the design of the famous salamander robot
%  developed at EPFL called \href{http://biorob.epfl.ch/salamandra}{Salamandra Robotica}.
